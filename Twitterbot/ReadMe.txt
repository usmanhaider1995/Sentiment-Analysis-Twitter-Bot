Following are the file which are present on GitHub and link is also attached to this document.
•	Code.ipynb
•	Code.html
•	Data.csv
Code.ipynb contains the code of whole project where we have done data preprocessing, tokenization, transformation, classification, evaluation.
Code.html file is the same as above code.ipynb but you do not need to run any environment. For the easiness of our reader, I have created it in html format so that they can open in chrome or any browser and can look into our project
Data.csv contain the data which we have taken from Kaggle as a source and it has over 50,000+ dataset.
You just need to run code.html file it will open into any browser and then you can view our code. If you want to run it in any environment (Jupiter notebook) only for training purpose it will take some time. So, that is why we had created code.html to save time.
